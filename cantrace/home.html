                    Contact tracing is a process involving a public health agent identifying, assessing, and monitoring individuals infected by a communicable disease and their exposed contacts to mitigate transmission. While contact-tracing is an effective tool, it is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to recall error. These shortcomings became strikingly evident due to COVID-19’s marked infectivity, particularly in densely populated environments, straining public health resources. As a result, our goal was to work on a digital contact tracing solution that involved using smartphone apps to track proximity interactions between people, which addressed the limitations of physical contact tracing due to their significant speed and scalability potential. We wanted to create a product for Canada as contact tracing apps natively help expedite and centralize the entire process to make the process simpler.

                            <h3>1. Age is an important factor in the likelihood of using such an app as older Canadians are more likely to use the app than young Canadians.</h3>
                            <h3>2. Concerns about privacy and government access to location data are the leading reasons against using a contact tracing app.</h3>
                            <h3>3. Secondary reasons are poor healthcare integration and guidance in-app.</h3>
                            <h3>4. The above factors seemed to be leading factors in downloading contact tracing apps in other countries as well.</h3>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">
                    
                    Keeping the user in mind, we investigated several different technologies to conduct tracing safely and reliably as that was a key factor for users. Various technical modalities exist to determine proximity traces, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Global Positioning System (GPS), WiFi and Quick Response (QR) codes among others. However, GPS and BLE dominated global discussions and were the most commonly used methods. GPS configures proximity by using timing and location measurements to identify overlap between app users’ paths. It poses the benefits of providing location context of exposures, and critical geolocation data to public health to identify infection hotspots and analyze disease spread.  However, GPS is unable to resolve between objects within 4.9 meters of each other, and signal accuracy is undermined near physical barriers (like tall buildings).</h3> <br>
                
                    <h3> 
                    BLE possesses key advantages over GPS including its ability to detect short distances between individuals and better discern proximity between those confined to the same geographical coordinates yet separated by elevation like in multi-storey buildings. Additionally, it is operational underground such as in tunnels or subways where satellite signalling is obstructed. Importantly, BLE’s capacity to configure proximity traces without processing or storing sensitive location data draws fewer privacy concerns. Based on these factors, we focused on building our product around BLE.</h3>

                    <h2>The Apple/Google API</h2>
                    <h3 class="mt-3"> Contact tracing apps using BLE were initially hampered by a limitation on devices using Apple’s iOS operating system which required phones to be perpetually “awake”, and apps open in the foreground to keep BLE readings active. Furthermore, BLE communications were stifled from signalling inter-compatibility issues between Android and iOS devices. Consequently, app adoption rates were significantly reduced, which further minimized their contact tracing potential. As a result, Google and Apple partnered to create an Application Program Interface (API), a program that mediated interactions between different software, which effectively resolved these limitations. The API was also lauded for preserving user privacy by operating within the decentralized framework and barring the co-existence of GPS technology on contact tracing apps adoptings it. Consequently, due to its technical and privacy advantages, it became the standard operating software for contact tracing apps like ours.</h3>

After conducting this research, it only supported our prior research and we knew we were on the right track to solve the user's biggest problems against such an app.</h3>

                    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                    <h3 class="mt-3">Our design recommendations operated within the API framework, capitalizing on its privacy and technical advantages, while incorporating user-centric features and healthcare elements to integrate conventional contact tracing efforts. Broadly, these recommendations augmented the API exposure notification platform with evidence-based characteristics to optimize both privacy and efficacy, help maximize app adoption rates, and minimize disease transmission. Without healthcare integration, apps did little to support contact tracing efforts by public health. Our solution was the bridge between technology and healthcare to create an effective tool against the infection, expedite recovery, and preserve civil liberties for the common good of all Canadians. </h3>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">When you're building a product that can potentially be used by 35 million people, the way your mind thinks changes a little. You get that extra motivation to complete the product with pristine perfection and work with your colleagues in going through the entire design process thoroughly and effectively. The most challenging aspect of the whole experience was to earn the trust of the user. Privacy and security were the biggest reasons people had against using such an app. So as a product designer, it was key to empathize with the user and understand that you need to design an experience that is simple to use and earns the trust of the users directly. All while keeping in mind that this app would be used by people of all ages. The way I solved this was looking at other apps that have a large age demographic and have a privacy aspect to it. In addition, I frequently communicated with our lawyer and privacy experts about the design and content to perfect the design.<br><br>
                        
                    By the time we presented our product to the government, they had already started developing their own app with Shopify and Blackberry and so we did not have much of a chance. But in retrospect, some features of our app were added into the COVID Alert app officially released by the federal government. The biggest learning I would take from this whole experience is to think swiftly, you never know when the opportunity may close.</h3>
