                            <h5>Problem</h5><h3>As we began to relax quarantine restrictions, we needed to find a way to more efficiently monitor transmission to prevent additional waves of virus transmission. At that time, isolation and quarantine measures in place were in the hope of reducing occurrence of novel cases and flatten the curve, but we needed something to expedite and aid the process.</h3><br>
                            
                            <h5>Solution</h5><h3>Contact tracing is an integral practice that the healthcare system employs to ensure isolation of at-risk contacts and curb further spread but it is all done manually; so we created an app that did all of that! CanTrace bridges technology with healthcare to create an effective tool against the infection, expedite recovery, and preserve civil liberties for the common good of all Canadians. </h3><br>

                        While contact-tracing is an effective tool, it is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to recall error. These shortcomings became strikingly evident due to COVID-19â€™s marked infectivity, particularly in densely populated environments, straining public health resources. As a result, our goal was to work on a digital contact tracing solution that involved using smartphone apps to track proximity interactions between people. We wanted to create a product for Canada as contact tracing apps natively help expedite and centralize the entire process to make it simpler.

                            <h3>1. Age is an important factor in the likelihood of using such an app as older Canadians are more likely to use the app than young Canadians.</h3>
                            <h3>2. Concerns about privacy and government access to location data are the leading reasons against using a contact tracing app.</h3>
                            <h3>3. Secondary reasons are poor healthcare integration and guidance in-app.</h3>
                            <h3>4. The above factors seemed to be leading factors in downloading contact tracing apps in other countries as well.</h3>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">
                    
                    Keeping the user in mind, we investigated several different technologies to conduct tracing safely and reliably as that was a key factor for users. Various technical modalities exist to determine proximity traces, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Global Positioning System (GPS), WiFi and Quick Response (QR) codes among others.</h3> <br>
                
                    <h3> 
                    BLE possesses key advantages over GPS including its ability to detect short distances between individuals and better discern proximity between those confined to the same geographical coordinates yet separated by elevation like in multi-storey buildings. Additionally, it is operational underground such as in tunnels or subways where satellite signalling is obstructed.</h3>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">When you're building a product that can potentially be used by 35 million people, the way your mind thinks changes a little. You get that extra motivation to complete the product with pristine perfection and work with your colleagues in going through the entire design process thoroughly and effectively. The most challenging aspect of the whole experience was to earn the trust of the user. Privacy and security were the biggest reasons people had against using such an app. So as a product designer, it was key to empathize with the user and understand that you need to design an experience that is simple to use and earns the trust of the users directly. All while keeping in mind that this app would be used by people of all ages. The way I solved this was looking at other apps that have a large age demographic and have a privacy aspect to it. In addition, I frequently communicated with our lawyer and privacy experts about the design and content to perfect the design.<br><br>
                        
                    By the time we presented our product to the government, they had already started developing their own app with Shopify and Blackberry and so we did not have much of a chance. But in retrospect, some features of our app were added into the COVID Alert app officially released by the federal government. The biggest learning I would take from this whole experience is to think swiftly, you never know when the opportunity may close.</h3>
