                            <h5>Problem</h5><h3>COVID-19 is a respiratory virus and spreads primarily via droplets, including through coughing and sneezing.  Furthermore, the virus can also be transmitted prior to symptom onset or from entirely asymptomatic cases which makes tracing contacts more difficult. <br><br> As we began to relax quarantine restrictions, we needed to find a way to more efficiently monitor transmission to prevent additional waves of virus transmission. At that time, isolation and quarantine measures in place were in the hope of reducing occurrence of novel cases and “flatten the curve.” With limited ICU and medical care capacity, the goal was to limit the healthcare burden associated with surges in cases. However, we needed something to expedite and aid the process.</h3><br>
                            
                            <h5>Solution</h5><h3>Contact tracing is an integral practice that the healthcare system employs to ensure isolation of at-risk contacts and curb further spread but it is all done manually; so we created an application that did all of that! CanTrace bridges technology with healthcare to create an effective tool against the infection, expedite recovery, and preserve civil liberties for the common good of all Canadians. </h3><br>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">Contact tracing works by having a health care staff identify an infected person and then manually trace back that patient’s steps in the past two weeks to find out where they may have gotten the infection from and who else they might have exposed to the infection. Contact tracing applications natively help expedite and centralize the entire process to make the process simpler.</h3>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">When you're building a product that can potentially be used by 35 million people, the way your mind thinks changes a little. You get that extra motivation to complete the product with perfection and work with your colleagues in going through the entire design process thoroughly and effectively. The most challenging aspect of the whole experience was to earn the trust of the user. Privacy and security were the biggest reasons people had against using such an application. So as a product designer, it was key to empathize with the user and understand that you need to design an experience that is simple to use and earns the trust of the users directly. All while keeping in mind that this application would be used by people of all ages. The way I solved this was looking at other applications that have a large age demographic and have a privacy aspect to it. In addition, I frequently communicated with our lawyer and privacy experts about the design and content to perfect the design.<br><br>
                        
                    By the time we presented our product to the government, they had already started developing their own application with Shopify and Blackberry and so we did not have much of a chance. The biggest learning I would take from this whole experience is to think swiftly, you never know when the opportunity may close. If I had another go at this, I would definitely hope to have one or two other product designers on board with me. I love working with people and when you’re working on such a huge project – having multiple design minded people would be a nice thing to have.  </h3>
