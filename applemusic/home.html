The focal point of this project was to enhance features, add new ones and improve usability overall to make the service we love even better. I use Apple Music every single day so myself along with many other heavy users understand the aspects that are not as polished or can take a solid revamp. It felt as if the desktop version was put in the backseat as the mobile app was the center of every design iteration as new waves of users kept flowing in. Year after year, the desktop version in particular has felt cluttered and not up to Apple's usual elegant design.</h3>

                            <h3>1. They both lack personalization. None of these services have a multitasking aspect that allow you to create the experience you want.</h3>
                            <h3>2. Both of these applications have a consistent user interface and layout with some exceptions throughout their mobile and desktop versions.</h3>

Very few use it, most just adjust the volume with their headphones or keyboard buttons. So I alotted more space to the time bar as that is something users use more often. Regarding the scrub, there is no visible scrub until you hover to slide the time on the old player which is quite confusing so I made sure there is something users can see and directly use. Given the breadth of space available, other functions can also be implemented at the users discretion like the heart to love music. The old player also does not allow you to go to the artist page by clicking on their name in the player. So that is something that I wanted to implement as well.</h3>

                    <h3>I wanted to reiterate Jason Yuan's words, "Album Artwork should be treated as part of the UI, and not a stand-alone visual component." The current aesthetic of Apple Music's album artwork is all over the space and doesn't quite create the sense of consistency throughout the entire interface. Users should know what they are looking for and where the text will be placed on artwork, not go searching for it (given that it is even there). On that point, some artwork doesn't have text so it can be difficult to infer what the playlist might be about.</h3>

With the album text in the top-left everytime it simplifies ambiguity and allows the rest of the work to be pictures that represent the playlist/album as a whole. The colors of the mesh gradient depend on the mood/vibe and I would love to see the mesh gradients animate on user input if it doesn't take a toll on battery...</h3>

Currently, when you click on a playlist/album, Apple Music will take you to an entirely different page showing the album and completely interrupt your browsing experience. So this way just by clicking on a playlist/album, it'll appear on the side-bar. The goal was to take the focus beyond the user interface and include the way they would interact with this feature. The mulititasking feature allows the user to quickly view the item, have multiple items at once and really use the side-bar to their hearts content. This makes the entire experience more enjoyable and user friendly. </h3>

                    <h2>Learnings, Reflections and Outcome</h2>
                    <h3 class="mt-3">This project was constructed over a span of two weeks and it took some time to precisely come up with the problems that I was going to tackle. This project in particular taught me how to work within the constraints of an existing product and design within an existing system. Since users are already familiar with these conventions, breaking them could hurt usability. When building upon such a huge platform, user testing is essential at every design update to ensure the design still aligns with user experience and business goals. It also opens up more points of focus and use cases to consider so that is something I would want to work on more if I were to do this again. As this was a passion project, I hope it sheds some light on a new possible angle of Apple Music. </h3>
