                            <h5>Problem</h5><h3>This was a recurring thought of mine ever since I saw Family YouTube channels. They document their child's growth and are able to share the memories with the world. While I didn't want to reach that extent - I wanted to always look back on my childhood and I often find myself asking my parents, "When was my first step?" or "When did I start talking" and they tell me but it's not captured in photos or videos explicitly.</h3><br>
                            
                            <h5>Solution</h5><h3>I created an application that parents can use to add, store and share memories of their child easily. They can build their child's story as they will be adding milestones throughout to cherish and evenutally share with their child when they get older!</h3><br>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">How many couples would want to document their child's early years and growth? These interviews allowed me to guage the parents this really could be for.</h3><br>
                    <h5>Here are the main questions I asked:</h5>
                    <h3>1. How old are you?</h3>
                    <h3>2. Are you married?</h3>
                    <h3>3. Do you have kids? And if not, do you plan on having them in the future?</h3>
                    <h3>4. Would you want to document milestones of your child's early years of growth?</h3>
                    <h3>5. What functions of the application would you expect?</h3><br>
                
                    <h5>Here's what I discovered:</h5>
                    <h3>1. Parents would find value in having a single go-to place to easily store their memories over applications like Facebook and Instagram.</h3>
                    <h3>2. Most would trust the application to keep their data private.</h3>
                    <h3>3. All would like the option to have a private network feature to share specific memories with their families.</h3>
                    <h3>4. Most would welcome a feature to celebrate milestones and also have timely parenting tips along the journey.</h3>
                    <h3>5. Most of the answers fell into my assumptions while some were out of my expectations. I was really happy about how intuitive and genuine the answers were. </h3><br><br>

The time allocation to kids were obviously vastly different but I wanted to empathize with the 2 main groups I was going to focus on - couples who are planning to have kids in the future and parents who already have kids. Using these personas, I was able to understand how busy life can be sometimes and it's important to capture the moments for the ones that are not able to experience it live. These two groups were in completely different stages of their life, but I knew that marketing to them with the right message was the key. </h3>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">This project was a perfect example of how UI/UX can truly help parents cherish the moments that matter the most. The goal of creating an application that stores memories, and making that experience as simple and intuitive as possible for parents is what really mattered to me. There are still many features that could be implemented as parenting is an everlasting joy of discovering new things. The biggest learning I took from this project was the importance of conducting thorough and engaging user interviews to get the most out of the interviewee. The way to do that is to be completely genuine with your intentions and project so they feel comfortable and provide you with the most accurate information. As this was a passion project, I hope it ignites ideas and encourages app creators to implement features that are sought out by many parents.</h3>
